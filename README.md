Veterinary-Clinic
The Veterinary Clinic Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the operations of a veterinary clinic. This project is built using a microservices architecture, where each microservice handles specific aspects of clinic management. The system also includes a frontend application to provide an intuitive interface for users.

How to install and run the project?
The project utilizes Node.js with the Express.js framework and employs Docker for containerization. PostgreSQL serves as the database system.

The project needs to be downloaded or cloned initially.

The subsequent steps involve installing dependencies and running the project, followed by executing the commands specific to each microservice.

npm init -y
npm install
npm start
This process needs to be repeated for each repository where the respective microservices are stored.
How to use the project
To use the project, execute the commands outlined earlier. When running these commands in the terminal, you will obtain URLs that you can open locally. The Swagger documentation will allow you to view the data available in your configured database in JSON format, as the microservice functions solely as the backend.

Requirements
Locally, you should adjust to the ports of your preference.
For deployment on AWS, you need to be familiar with ECR, EC2 and Load Balancing AWS
